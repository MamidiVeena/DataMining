1. Transforming data into a sparse Matrix
2. transform docs into lists of words
3. Build sparse matrix from a list of documents
4. To decrease the importance of popular words in similarity computations, we usually scale the matrix by the *Inverse Document Frequency* (IDF).
5. Normalizing(L2 normalization) the vectors helps us compute cosine similarity more efficiently.
6. Use Cosine Similarity
